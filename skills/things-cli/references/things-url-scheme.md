The URL scheme lets pro users and developers of other apps send commands to Things. This page explains how it works.

![](https://culturedcode.com/frozen/2018/03/things-url-scheme-robot.png)

Here are some examples of commands that Things understands:

- Create a new to-do named “Buy milk”.
- Show the Today list.
- Show all to-dos tagged with “Errand”.
- Search all to-dos for “shipping address”.

There’s also a powerful JSON-based command that lets you create entire projects, together with all their notes, headings, and to-dos.

## Overview

Commands are sent to Things by constructing special URL links of the form:

```
things:///commandName?
    parameter1=value1&
    parameter2=value2&
    ...
```

Opening these links will launch the app and execute the command. Here’s how you would tell Things to create a to-do:

```
things:///add?
    title=Buy%20milk&
    notes=High%20fat
```

## Support for x-callback-url

All commands support the [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com/) convention by calling the provided `x-success`, `x-error` or `x-cancel` callbacks as appropriate. Many commands return parameters to the `x-success` callback.

## Getting IDs

Some commands require you to provide IDs of to-dos or lists. Here’s how you can retrieve them in Things.

To get the ID of a to-do:

- On the Mac, control-click on the to-do and choose **Share** → **Copy Link**.
- On iOS, tap the to-do to open it and in the toolbar at the bottom, tap → **Share** → **Copy Link**.

To get the ID of a list:

- On the Mac, control-click on the list in the sidebar and choose **Share** → **Copy Link**.
- On iOS, navigate into the list and at the top right of the screen, tap → **Share** → **Copy Link**.

## Authorization

For security reasons, commands that modify existing Things data require an authorization token to run. This prevents malicious links from modifying your data. This token should be passed as the parameter `auth-token` along with the other parameters in the command. You can find your unique token in Things’ settings:

- On the Mac, go to **Things** → **Settings** → **General** → **Enable Things URLs** → **Manage**.
- On iOS, go to **Settings** → **General** → **Things URLs**.

## Data Types

The commands use the following data types for their parameters:

`string`

Percent encoded. Maximum un-encoded string length: 4,000 characters unless otherwise specified.

`date string`

String. Either `today`, `tomorrow` or a date string of the form `yyyy-mm-dd`. E.g. `2017-09-29`. Things will also attempt to interpret natural language dates such as `in 3 days` or `next tuesday`. These must be provided in English, regardless of the user’s device language.

`time string`

A string describing a time in the local time zone. E.g. 9:30PM or 21:30.

`date time string`

A `date string` followed by the `@` symbol and then followed by a `time string`. E.g. 2026-02-25@14:00.

`ISO8601 date time string`

A date-time string conforming to [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601). E.g. `2026-03-10T14:30:00Z` or `2026-03-10T14:30:00+01:00`.

`boolean`

A boolean value. Either `true` or `false`.

`JSON string`

A string in JSON format. See [http://www.json.org/](http://www.json.org/) for more details.

## Enabling the URL Scheme

The first time you execute a command via the URL scheme, Things will ask you if you want to enable this feature. Simply answer with **Enable**.

You can later change this in Things’ settings:

- On the Mac, go to **Things** → **Settings** → **General**.
- On iOS, go to **Settings** → **General** → **Things URLs**.

## Version

The current version of the URL scheme is 2.

## add command

Add a to-do. For example, create a to-do in the inbox:

```
things:///add?
    title=Book%20flights
```

Create a to-do with a tag and notes set to start this evening:

```
things:///add?
    title=Buy%20milk&
    notes=Low%20fat.&
    when=evening&
    tags=Errand
```

Create several to-dos and add them to the Shopping project:

```

Create a to-do in the “This Evening” list with a reminder at 6PM:

## json command (for Developers)

Things also has an advanced, JSON-based add command that allows more control over the projects and to-dos imported into Things. This command is intended to be used by app developers or other people familiar with scripting or programming.

We’ve created a set of Swift helper classes that you can use to more easily generate the JSON needed for this command. Get the code from the [Things JSON Coder GitHub repository](https://github.com/culturedcode/ThingsJSONCoder).

Example:

```
things:///json?data=
  [
    {
      "type": "project",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Go Shopping",
        "items": [
          {
            "type": "to-do",
            "attributes": {
              "title": "Bread"
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "to-do",
            "attributes": {
              "title": "Milk"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
```

## Parameters

`auth-token`

String. The Things URL scheme . This is required whenever the provided JSON data contains an `update` operation.

`data`

JSON string. The JSON should be an array containing `to-do` and `project` objects (see below).

`reveal`

Boolean. Whether or not to navigate to and show the newly created to-do or project. If multiple items have been created, the first one will be shown. Default: `false`.

## Return parameters on x-success

`x-things-ids`

JSON string. An array of IDs of the to-dos and projects created that were specified in the top level JSON array. The IDs of the to-dos created inside projects are not returned.

## Describing Things objects in JSON

Each operation consists of the following fields:

- `type` The type of the object. These are described in more detail below. This field is required.
- `operation` The operation to perform on the object. Either `create` (create a new object) or `update` (update the fields of an existing object). If this field is not present, the operation is assumed to be `create`. Currently only `to-do` and `project` objects can be updated.
- `id` Required for update operations, this is the ID of the object to update.
- `attributes` A dictionary of attributes, which correspond to the properties of the object itself. The `attributes` field must be included but all attributes themselves are optional.
```
{
    "type": "to-do",
    "operation": "update",
    "id": "Di9deEJeUkVZaDEdbnzQZw",
    "attributes": {
        "deadline": "today"
    }
}
```

### To-do

```
{
  "type": "to-do",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Milk"
  }
}
```
- `type` is `to-do`.
- `attributes`:
	- `title` - string. The title of the to-do.
	- `notes` - string. The text to use for the notes field of the to-do. Maximum length: 10,000 characters.
	- `when` - string. Possible values: `today`, `tomorrow`, `evening`, `anytime`, `someday`, a [date string](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/#overview-data-types-date-string), or a [date time string](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/#overview-data-types-date-time-string). Using a date time string adds a reminder for that time. The time component is ignored if `anytime` or `someday` is specified.

### URL Encoded Example

All of the above JSON examples must have the white space removed and then be URL encoded before they can be used. For example:

```
things:///json?data=
  [
    {
      "type": "to-do",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Buy milk"
      }
    }
  ]
```

After removing white space:

```
things:///json?data=[{"type":"to-do","attributes":{"title":"Buy milk"}}]
```

After URL encoding:

```
things:///json?data=%5B%7B%22type%22:%22to-do%22,%22attributes%22:%7B%22title%22:%22Buy%20milk%22%7D%7D%5D
```

## add-json command

Deprecated. The `json` command can be used for adding items via JSON.
